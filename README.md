### What is ACTC? üíª

ACTC is a new method for estimation the relation threshold for a cold-start knowledge graph completion.
ACTC leverages a limited set of labeled and a large set of unlabeled data in order to calculate per-relation thresholds.
Basing on these thresholds and plausibility scores calculated by a knowledge graph embedding model, one 
can make a decision about whether a new triple should be included to the knowledge graph or not.
Mostly important, it helps to find thresholds in a setting where there is only a limited set of available manual 
annotations.

### Usage üöÄ

The ACTC could be launched by running the `main.py` script. 

Here is an example:

```
python main.py 
--path_to_data path/to/directory/with/data/and/KGE/model/predictions/
--output_dir path/to/output/directory 
--path_to_config path/to/config/file
```
An example of a directory where data and KGE model predictions are stored (for CoDEx-s dataset + ComplEx embeddings): `data`

An example of a config file: `scripts/configs/config.json`

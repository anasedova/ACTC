### What is ACTC?

ACTC is a method for estimation the relation threshold for a cold-start knowledge graph completion.
ACTC leverages a limited set of labeled and a large set of unlabeled data in order to calculate per-relation thresholds.
Basing on these thresholds and plausibility scores calculated by a knowledge graph embedding model, one 
can make a decision about whether a new triple should be included to the knowledge graph or not.
Mostly important, it helps to find thresholds in a setting where there is only a limited set of available manual 
annotations.

### Usage

`python main.py --path_to_models directory/with/KGE/model/predictions/are/stored 
--output_dir path/to/output/directory --path_to_config path/to/config/file`

An example of a config file: `scripts/configs/config.json`
